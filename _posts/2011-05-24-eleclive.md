## About the Project

I like electronic music. If you go to a DJ's show, you can't see what they are doing. You don't know that they are actually live or not. Yes, music is good, but interaction between audience is much less then a band's performance, because DJs don't use real instruments. I wanted to make something that can control virtual instruments and interact with audience, too.  So I thought about using AR to make live performance more visual. Please contact me if you want to know the details.
