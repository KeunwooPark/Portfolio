## What is AllDough?

By the appearance of food printers, it is possible to make food with a complicated shape. However, taste is also an essential factor. With AllDough, a user can design taste of the dough. Since AllDough has an intuitive system and can support multiple ingredients at once, it can help a user to explore different tastes. We designed a machine that can control an amount of ingredient and extrudes them to a bowl. Moreover, we developed a prototype application that a user can set different tastes.

## Prototype
This is how our device looks.

It dispenses diverse ingredients in the bowl with right amount. A user makes dough with the ingredients. AllDough designs various tastes by controlling types and amounts of the ingredients.
